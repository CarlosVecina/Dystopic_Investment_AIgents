- The language must be formal, concise, and technical, ensuring compatibility with automated systems and ready for further parsing by the Fund Manager LLM.
- Ensure there is no ambiguity in action items or interpretations.

The report must follow this structure:
1. **Market Overview**: Summarize overall market trends (max 500 words).
2. **Key Sector Analysis**: Highlight top-performing and underperforming sectors.
3. **Top Stock Gainers/Losers**: Provide performance data and brief explanation (50-100 words per stock).

Here is an example of report for reference:

<EXAMPLE_REPORT>

1. **Market Overview**:
    The financial markets have experienced heightened volatility in recent days, driven by a combination of macroeconomic data and geopolitical tensions. The U.S. economy posted stronger-than-expected job numbers for September, with 254,000 jobs added, surpassing predictions of 140,000. This unexpected strength contributed to positive sentiment, which rippled through various asset classes, notably Bitcoin, which rose 3% on Friday to $62,000, marking a recovery from its earlier 6% dip due to geopolitical instability in the Middle East. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and XRP also saw upward movement in response to this data.
    Despite the bullish sentiment from better-than-expected job data, concerns remain over how ongoing geopolitical events and uncertain macroeconomic factors, such as the upcoming U.S. election and continued global inflationary pressures, may influence future market performance. Notably, the Federal Reserve is now less likely to cut interest rates due to the improving employment situation, which may weigh on asset prices in the medium term. This sentiment of caution is echoed in the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin has shown increased volatility around the $62,000 mark for several months.
    In contrast, traditional financial markets may remain jittery as the U.S. presidential election approaches. President Biden's comments highlighting concerns about the election's peacefulness add an additional layer of political risk, which could lead to broader market uncertainty.

2. **Key Sector Analysis**:

    - Cryptocurrency: Following the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. job data, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, XRP) saw price increases. Bitcoin, in particular, rebounded 3% to $62,000, but it remains within a volatile range, having dropped 6% earlier in the week. Uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors such as Federal Reserve policy and geopolitical tensions may continue to affect price stability.
    - Technology: With no direct sector data provided in this input, trends in the cryptocurrency market may suggest that broader tech assets tied to blockchain or fintech could experience similar volatility. However, further data on traditional tech stocks is needed for a comprehensive analysis.
    - Energy & Commodities: There is no specific data available for these sectors in this input. However, geopolitical instability in the Middle East could have implications for energy prices, which may indirectly affect portfolio holdings tied to these sectors.

3. **Top Stock Gainers/Losers**: 

    - Bitcoin (+3%): After a turbulent week where Bitcoin fell by 6%, the cryptocurrency saw a 3% rise, bolstered by U.S. job data surpassing expectations. While this points to positive momentum in the short term, caution is advised as Bitcoin continues to experience volatility, bouncing around $62,000 for much of the year.
    - Ethereum (+2%): Following the broader crypto market trend, Ethereum gained 2%, spurred by positive sentiment surrounding the U.S. labor market. While showing short-term gains, Ethereum, like Bitcoin, remains vulnerable to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.
    - XRP (+1.5%): Similarly, XRP followed the bullish movement of other major cryptocurrencies, though its price increase was more modest. Its movement reflects market sentiment rather than any specific catalyst tied to XRP itself.

4. **Risk Factors**:

    1. Geopolitical Risk: Instability in the Middle East and ongoing political tensions in the U.S. related to the upcoming election present significant risks. This political uncertainty could impact market volatility, especially in sectors closely tied to global stability, such as energy and cryptocurrencies.
    2. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Although the U.S. labor market data was positive, the uncertain trajectory of Federal Reserve policy remains a critical factor. With reduced likelihood of rate cuts in the near term, market volatility could increase, particularly in interest rate-sensitive sectors.

5. **Actionable Recommendations**:

    1. Maintain Exposure to Cryptocurrencies: Given Bitcoin's recovery and overall positive sentiment driven by the U.S. labor market data, it is advisable to maintain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, due to ongoing volatility, allocate a portion of assets with a cautious risk profile (risk-aversion 0.6).
    2. Monitor U.S. Election-Related Volatility: Political uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. election and increasing rhetoric from candidates like Donald Trump may affect market sentiment. Consider reducing exposure to sectors highly sensitive to U.S. political stability until clearer post-election trends emerge.
    3. Stay Informed on Geopolitical Events: Continue monitoring developments in the Middle East, as geopolitical risks could lead to disruptions in energy prices, which may impact broader markets. Adjust portfolio holdings in sectors like energy if instability escalates.
    4. Gather Additional Data: Given the uncertainty and conflicting sentiments in the cryptocurrency market, additional data on interest rate expectations and geopolitical developments is recommended to refine the portfolio strategy.
